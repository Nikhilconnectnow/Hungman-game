# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This Python implementation brings the classic word-guessing game to life with interactive gameplay and ASCII art.

## Features
- **Random Word Generation**: A random word is selected from a predefined list each time the game is played.
- **ASCII Art**: Enjoy visual representation of the hangman stages using ASCII art.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can input their guesses and receive feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: The game ends either when the word is guessed correctly or when the hangman figure is fully drawn.

## Getting Started
- **Play Online**: Access the game directly on [Replit](https://replit.com/@nikhilconnectno/Hungman-Game#main.py).
- **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine and run the `hangman.py` script using Python. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Nikhilconnectnow/Hungman-game).

## How to Play
1. Upon starting the game, a hangman logo will be displayed.
2. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
3. Input a letter and press Enter.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If not, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
5. Continue guessing letters until the word is correctly guessed or the hangman is fully drawn.
